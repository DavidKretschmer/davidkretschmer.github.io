Welcome! I am a sociologist and Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

My research interests are in the fields of intergroup relations, immigrant social and cultural integration, religion and gender, stereotyping and discrimination, social network analysis, and quantitative methods more generally. I received my PhD from the University of Mannheim in 2023 with a thesis on the gendered nature of intergroup relations between Muslim and non-Muslim youth. On this webpage, you find an overview of my [publications](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/publications/) and my [CV](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/assets/vita.pdf).


News
======

- **June 2025:** New [visualization paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231251349634) published in _Socius_. This paper investigates gender differences in the leisure time activities of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in Germany. It shows that Muslim girls are less likely to engage in unstructured activities outside of their home, but that differences become smaller as they transition to young adulthood.
- **December 2024:** New [paper](https://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sf/soae169/7918057) published in _Social Forces_. This paper shows that homophily based on sociodemographic characteristics is stronger in strong ties than in weak ties---across a wide range of sociodemographics and countries.
- **September 2024:** New [paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2024.2399725) published in _Ethnic and Racial Studies_. This paper shows that gender segregation is widespread among adolescents in Germany, but particularly so among Muslim youth. This difference is driven by Muslim youths' stronger chastity norms, which complicate cross-gender friendships.
- **August 2024:** New [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-024-01505-x) published in _Sex Roles_ on the influence cross-gender friends have on adolescents' gender role attitudes and how this varies between boys and girls
