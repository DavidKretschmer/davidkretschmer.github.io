Welcome! I am a sociologist and Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

I just defended my dissertation at the University of Mannheim, where I worked as a researcher and assistant lecturer during my PhD studies. 

My research interests are in the fields of intergroup relations, immigrant social and cultural integration, social network analysis, and quantitative methods more generally. On this webpage, you find an overview of my [publications](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/publications/) and my [CV](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/assets/vita.pdf).



News
======

- **Dec 2023:** New [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176723001670) published in _International Journal of Intercultural Relations_, together with Kathrin LÃ¤mmermann and Lars Leszczensky. In the paper, we show that Muslim girls' lesser involvement in interreligious friendships (compared to boys) can partially be explained by factors related to gendered religious norms -- exactly those factors that are also responsible for Muslim girls' lower levels of intergroup dating.
- **Nov 2023:** New [comment](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/727823) published in _American Journal of Sociology_. The comment is a methodological critique of Smith et al.'s 2016 paper on [Ethnic Composition and Friendship Segregation: Differential Effects for Adolescent Natives and Immigrants](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/684032). Also take a look at Smith et al.'s [reply](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727858)
