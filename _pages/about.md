Welcome! My name is David. I am a researcher at the University of Mannheim and a PhD student in Sociology. Starting November 2023, I will join Nuffield College as a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow.


My research interests are in the fields of intergroup relations, immigrant social and cultural integration, and social network analysis.

My research has been published in _Social Forces_, _European Sociological Research_, _Social Networks_, _Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies_ and other outlets.
