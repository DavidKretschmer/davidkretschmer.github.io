Welcome! I am a sociologist and Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

My research interests are in the fields of gender and religion, intergroup relations, immigrant social and cultural integration, stereotyping and discrimination, social network analysis, and quantitative methods more generally. On this webpage, you find an overview of my [publications](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/publications/) and my [CV](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/assets/vita.pdf).

I recently received my PhD from the University of Mannheim, with a thesis on the gendered nature of intergroup relations between Muslim and non-Muslim youth. If you're interested, take a look at the thesis [here](https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/66316/1/kretschmer.pdf).



News
======

- **Dec 2023:** New [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176723001670) published in _International Journal of Intercultural Relations_, together with Kathrin LÃ¤mmermann and Lars Leszczensky. In the paper, we show that Muslim girls' lesser involvement in interreligious friendships (compared to boys) can partially be explained by factors related to gendered religious norms -- exactly those factors that are also responsible for Muslim girls' lower levels of intergroup dating.
- **Nov 2023:** New [comment](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/727823) published in _American Journal of Sociology_.
