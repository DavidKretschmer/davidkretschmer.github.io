Welcome! My name is David, and I am a researcher at the University of Mannheim and a PhD student in Sociology with research interests in the fields of intergroup relations, immigrant social and cultural integration, and social network analysis.

My dissertation project investigates the interplay of gender and religion in shaping the friendship networks of Muslim and non-Muslim youth in the European context. It assesses two main questions: 

1. Does the religious friendship segregation of Muslim boys and girls emerge from different mechansims?
2. Are the friendship networks of Muslim youth more gender segregated than those of non-Muslim boys, and which consequences does this have for societal integration?

My research has been published in _Social Forces_, _European Sociological Research_, _Social Networks_, _Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies_ and other outlets.
