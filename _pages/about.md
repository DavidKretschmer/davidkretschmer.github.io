Welcome! I am a sociologist and Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

My research interests are in the fields of gender and religion, intergroup relations, immigrant social and cultural integration, stereotyping and discrimination, social network analysis, and quantitative methods more generally. On this webpage, you find an overview of my [publications](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/publications/) and my [CV](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/assets/vita.pdf).

I recently received my PhD from the University of Mannheim, with a thesis on the gendered nature of intergroup relations between Muslim and non-Muslim youth. If you're interested, take a look at the thesis [here](https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/66316/1/kretschmer.pdf).



News
======

- **August 2024:** [Lars Leszczensky](https://larsleszczensky.wordpress.com) and I are seeking applications for two PhD positions in the project _Gender-specific Mechanisms of Social Integration of Muslim Youth_, funded by the German Research Foundation and based at Goethe University Frankfurt. One position involves working with quantitative research methods, the other with qualitative methods. The quantitative position does not require German language skills, but the qualitative position does. Both calls for applications can be found [here](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/48794784/FB03___Gesellschaftswissenschaften) and more information on the project can be found [here](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/156008984/Gendered_mechanisms_of_social_integration_among_Muslim_youth__German_Research_Foundation__DFG?locale=en). The deadline for applications is September 19, 2024. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions
- **August 2024:** New [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-024-01505-x) published in _Sex Roles_ on the influence cross-gender friends have on adolescents' gender role attitudes and how this varies between boys and girls
- **June 2024:** I'm flattered and honoured to have received the [_Lorenz von Stein Award_](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en/news/items/former-mzes-employee-david-kretschmer-receives-the-prestigious-lorenz-von-stein-award) for the best dissertation at the School of Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim in 2023
- **Dec 2023:** New [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176723001670) published in _International Journal of Intercultural Relations_, together with Kathrin LÃ¤mmermann and Lars Leszczensky. In the paper, we show that Muslim girls' lesser involvement in interreligious friendships (compared to boys) can partially be explained by factors related to gendered religious norms -- exactly those factors that are also responsible for Muslim girls' lower levels of intergroup dating.
- **Nov 2023:** New [comment](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/727823) published in _American Journal of Sociology_. The comment is a methodological critique of Smith et al.'s 2016 paper on [Ethnic Composition and Friendship Segregation: Differential Effects for Adolescent Natives and Immigrants](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/684032). Also take a look at Smith et al.'s [reply](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727858)
