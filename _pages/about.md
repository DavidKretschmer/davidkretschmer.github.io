Welcome! I am a sociologist and Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

My research interests are in the fields of intergroup relations, immigrant social and cultural integration, religion, and gender, stereotyping and discrimination, social network analysis, and quantitative methods more generally. I recently received my PhD from the University of Mannheim, with a thesis on the gendered nature of intergroup relations between Muslim and non-Muslim youth. On this webpage, you find an overview of my [publications](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/publications/) and my [CV](https://davidkretschmer.github.io/assets/vita.pdf).

- **December 2024:** New [paper](https://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sf/soae169/7918057) published in _Social Forces_. This paper shows that homophily based on sociodemographic characteristics is stronger in strong ties--across a wide range of sociodemographics and countries.
- **September 2024:** New [paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2024.2399725) published in _Ethnic and Racial Studies_. This paper shows that gender segregation is widespread among adolescents in Germany, but particularly so among Muslim youth. This difference is driven by Muslim youths' stronger chastity norms, which complicate cross-gender friendships.

- **August 2024:** New [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-024-01505-x) published in _Sex Roles_ on the influence cross-gender friends have on adolescents' gender role attitudes and how this varies between boys and girls
- **June 2024:** I'm flattered and honoured to have received the [_Lorenz von Stein Award_](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en/news/items/former-mzes-employee-david-kretschmer-receives-the-prestigious-lorenz-von-stein-award) for the best dissertation at the School of Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim in 2023
- **December 2023:** New [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176723001670) published in _International Journal of Intercultural Relations_, together with Kathrin LÃ¤mmermann and Lars Leszczensky. In the paper, we show that Muslim girls' lesser involvement in interreligious friendships (compared to boys) can partially be explained by factors related to gendered religious norms -- exactly those factors that are also responsible for Muslim girls' lower levels of intergroup dating.
- **November 2023:** New [comment](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/727823) published in _American Journal of Sociology_. The comment is a methodological critique of Smith et al.'s 2016 paper on [Ethnic Composition and Friendship Segregation: Differential Effects for Adolescent Natives and Immigrants](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/684032). Also take a look at Smith et al.'s [reply](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727858)
